    /** @brief Defines an object that handles a specific rendering API (like OpenGL, Metal, Vulkan, D3D, ...).
     *
     *  The driver is responsible for the management of all objects created specifically for an API. Take as an example
     *  the buffers on your GPU. Those buffers are created inside the driver's mechanism, and are destroyed when the
     *  driver doesn't need them anymore.
     *
     *  The buffers are all attached to a buffer's id. This id corresponds to the GF::Buffer instance they are created
     *  from. When the original GF::Buffer is modified (dirty, or touched or whatever) the driver's buffer is updated
     *  to ensure its data is up-to-date.
